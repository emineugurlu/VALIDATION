🚀 HTML and CSS Form Validation
Many developers assume that form validation must rely solely on JavaScript, but in reality, HTML's built-in validation features and the power of CSS can handle most validation tasks efficiently and effectively. This project showcases how to leverage these features to create a seamless and user-friendly form validation experience without the need for complex JavaScript.

The project focuses on using HTML5 form attributes such as required, pattern, min, max, and type for client-side validation, along with CSS for providing real-time feedback to users. These tools allow for simple, yet powerful form validation techniques that ensure data accuracy and improve the overall user experience.

🌟 Features
✔ HTML5 Validation – Using native HTML5 form attributes to validate user input.
✔ CSS Styling for Validation – Applying CSS to visually highlight valid or invalid input fields in real time.
✔ User Feedback – Displaying clear, non-intrusive feedback about the form's state (valid/invalid) as users fill out the form.
✔ Responsive Design – The form is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
